## Codebase General Improvement

The code has been improved for long-term sustainability. I have made some changes so the code is semantic structure of the HTML elements, and have consolidated CSS codes.

## Semantic HTML elements update

Now it follows:
```
<header>
<main>
  <section>
  <section>
<footer>
```

## HTML elements follows logical structure

Each HTML element has its own CSS style like header, header h1, header div, header div ul.

## Accessible alt attributes

Images and icons have added alt attributes to increase the SEO search result.

## Heading in sequential order

Now all headers starts with h1, instead of some starts with h2 or h3.

## Title is concise, descriptive

The website title is not changed to its business name and is descriptive.
